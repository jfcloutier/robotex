<p>First things first: All Hail <a href="http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconf2015/torben-hoffmann">Torben Hoffmann</a>! Torben is pioneering the use of Elixir to control Mindstorm robots. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8SZaV96_vk">talk</a> is what got me fired up. Torben generously <a href="https://twitter.com/LeHoff/status/611789138342342656">offered to help</a> as I stumble along. (Thank you!)</p>

<p>I ordered Lego Mindstorm EV3 kit and a microSD card. They arrived yesterday. <img src="ev3.jpg" alt="ev3"></p>

<p>As soon as I can pry the EV3 from the hands of my 12 year-old son Will, I will follow the instructions from Torben's <a href="http://www.elixirconf.eu/static/upload/media/14382623667112154elixirconflego.pdf">Elixir Conf 2015 slides</a> and:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="http://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> Linux kernel with EV3 hardware drivers</li>
<li>Install Erlang and Elixir on the card</li>
<li>Install Torben's Elixir <a href="https://github.com/lehoff/ev3">EV3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lehoff/ev3bt">EV3 Bluetooth</a> libraries</li>
<li>Boot the EV3 brick from the SD card.</li>
<li>Build a robot (with Will of course)</li>
<li>Write "hello robot" in Elixir and run it<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I will be working from my Lenovo G710 laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 </p>

<p>Let's see how easy or hard it will be for me to get there.</p>

<h2>Installing ev3dev on the EV3 brick</h2>
<p>Easy peasy. 30 minutes later: <img alt="ev3dev" src="images/ev3dev_ssh.png"/>

<h1><a id="day-two---june-22-2015" class="anchor" href="#day-two---june-22-2015" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Day Two - June 22, 2015</h1>

<h2>Installing Erlang and Elixir</h2>

<p>Installing Erlang via <pre>apt-get install Erlang</pre> took about 2 hours (the brick with a microSD card is not exactly blazing fast) but went without a glitch.</p>

<p>I then installed Elixir from the <a class="anchor" href="http://elixir-lang.org/install.html#precompiled-package">pre-compiled package</a> by doing </p>

<pre>
  wget https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/releases/download/v1.0.4/Precompiled.zip
  apt-get install unzip
  mkdir /opt/elixir
  unzip Precompiled.zip -d /opt/elixir
</pre>

<p>and then adding /opt/elixir/bin to the PATH in my .bashrc by logging out root and logging in as myself (the ev3dev setup process had me add a user for myself)
and adding this at the end of my .bashrc</p>

<pre>
export ELIXIR=/opt/elixir 

PATH=$PATH:$ELIXIR/bin
</pre>

<p> and then doing <pre>source .bashrc</pre></p>

<p>That took very little time and now Elixir runs on the EV3. How cool is that? <img alt="elixir on ev3" src="images/ev3_iex.png"/></p>

<h2>Bluetooth woes</h2>

<p>I spent more hours than I care to admit trying to establish a network connection via Bluetooth. The first roadbloack was missing Bluetooth firmware on my laptop. I took me a while
to <a class="anchor" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1242079"> figure this one out</a>. Once Bluetooth on my laptop was functional, I could successfully
pair my laptop's with the ev3dev over Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Next step was establishing a network connection over Bluetooth. For that, I needed to install <a class="anchor" href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/blueman/">Bluetooth Manager</a>
on my laptop as <a class="anchor" href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/connecting-to-the-internet-via-bluetooth/">instructed</a> and setup network settings. No problem.</p>

<p>This is where I ran into a roadblock I have yet to overcome. The "Network Connection" button in <img alt="network connection"  src="images/bluetooth-device-network-connection.png"/> won't do anything.
After googling the living daylight out of this, I suspect this may have to do with missing Bluetooth security permissions on my laptop. I have an idea on how to go about it but now, for some reason,
Ev3dev won't reboot. So I am re-initializing the microSD card with a fresh image and see how far I can get this time. This is frustrating.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Will is racing along building a robot and is having a grand old time. <img alt="will robot 1" src="images/will_robot_1.jpg"/>
<img alt="will robot 2" src="images/will_robot_2.jpg"/> </p>

<h1><a id="day-three---june-27-2015" class="anchor" href="#day-three---june-27-2015" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Day Three - June 27, 2015</h1>

<h2> @&^%+%$ Bluetooth! </h2>

<p>After spending way too many hours trying to establish a Bluetooth connection between EV3DEV and Ubuntu 14.04 I gave up in disgust. I won't describe my many unsuccessful attempts. I  decided to try WiFi instead and I bought a USB WiFi dongle.</p>

<p> <img alt="wifi dongle" src="images/ev3_wifi.jpg"/></p>

<p>ev3dev recognized the WiFi dongle after a reboot and I thought the rest would be easy. Wrong. Entering my (long) WiFi password turned out to be an ordeal. The onscreen keyboard on the EV3 is barely usable and I had to race to beat a timeout - if I took too long, the EV3 would abort the process. I didn't want to change my password and reset all my devices. So it took me a good half-hour to hone my skills and beat the clock. I finally got a connection.</p>

<p>I can <strong>finally</strong> connect to the EV3 without a USB cable. </p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<h2>Torben's NDC 2015 talk</h2>

<p>I watched Torben's <a href="https://vimeo.com/131639825"> NDC 2015 talk on Elixir and Mindstorm</a> where he bravely silences his inner chicken and gives a live demo of an Elixir-controlled robot. The demo gods smile upon him and it works! After my dispiriting battle with Bluetooth on Ubuntu, this rekindles my spirit.</p>

<p>I learned from his talk that the EV3 Elixir library is out-of-date with the latest release of ev3dev. I guess my next step is seeing how much of an upgrade is required.</p>
