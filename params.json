{"name":"Robotex","tagline":"Adventures in robotics with Mindstorm EV3 and Elixir","body":"# Day One - June 19, 2015\r\n\r\nFirst things first: All Hail to [Torben Hoffman](http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconf2015/torben-hoffmann)! Torben is pioneering the use of Elixir (and concurrency-oriented programming) to program Mindstorm robots. His [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8SZaV96_vk) is what got me fired up. Torben generously [offered to help](https://twitter.com/LeHoff/status/611789138342342656) as I stumble along. (Thank you!)\r\n\r\nSo. I received the Lego Mindstorm EV3 kit and a microSD card yesterday. ![ev3](https://twitter.com/jfcloutier/status/611880757913587712)\r\n\r\nAs soon as I can pry my Will, my 12 year-old son from it, my next steps will be to follow Torben's instructions from his [Elixir Conf 2015 slides](http://www.elixirconf.eu/static/upload/media/14382623667112154elixirconflego.pdf) and:\r\n\r\n1. Install the [ev3dev](http://www.ev3dev.org/) Linux kernel with EV3 hardware drivers\r\n2. Install Erlang and Elixir on the card\r\n3. Install Torben's Elixir [EV3](https://github.com/lehoff/ev3) and [EV3 Bluetooth](https://github.com/lehoff/ev3bt)libraries\r\n4. Boot the EV3 brick from the SD card.\r\n5. Build a robot (with Will of course)\r\n6. Write and run \"Hello robot\"  \r\n\r\nLet's see how easy or hard it will be for me to get there.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
